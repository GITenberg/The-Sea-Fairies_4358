description: When Liv Bloom lands an art scholarship at Wickham Hall, it's her ticket
  out of the foster system. Despite the school's weird traditions and rituals, Liv
  couldn't be happier especially when Malcolm Astor starts falling for her. Fellow
  scholarship kid Gabe Nichols warns her not to get involved with Malcolm, but things
  are finally going Liv's way ... that is, until she is viciously murdered. In death,
  she discovers that she's the latest victim of a dark conspiracy.
